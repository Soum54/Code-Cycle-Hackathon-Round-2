# Code Cycle Hackathon
- In the first round, we were given various tasks, such as deep learning coding and cryptography. We earned points for each task, which led to our selection for the second round of the hackathon.
- In the second round, we were given a problem statement and asked to prepare a solution for it. We developed several components within the given timeframe, as summarized briefly below.

# Problem Statement
- Traditional education often lacks the flexibility to accommodate diverse learning styles, causing students to struggle with topics that don’t align with their pace or preferences. This project aims to develop an AI-driven platform that adapts to each student’s needs, optimizing learning outcomes through personalized, interactive, and responsive content.
